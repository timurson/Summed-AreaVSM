# Summed-Area Soft Variance Shadows
I first learned of Variance Shadow Mapping technique from the [GPU Gems 3](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/part-ii-light-and-shadows/chapter-8-summed-area-variance-shadow-maps) article back when I was an undergrad.  At
the time I thought it was a pretty neat way of generating shadows that produced some nice results.  The part that I didn't quite understand at the time was how to generate summed-area shadow textures and use them
to produce soft shadows.  Now that I have more experience with graphics API under my belt, I decided to revisit this topic and to implement Summed-Area Soft Variance Shadows in all of their natural glory.

## Main Features:
*  Deferred shading with Real-Time soft variance shadow utilizing summed-area table.
*  Summed-area textures can be generated using compute shader or using Hensley's recursive doubling method.
*  Percentage-Closer Soft Shadows are implemented as was described in Fernando's 2005 paper.
*  Run-time debugging of shadow map and light configuration thru the utilization of Dear ImGui library.

## Things I Learned:
*  Donâ€™t go above 1K for the size of your SATs or your shadow will fail!
*  Summed-Area Tables will greatly magnify all the problems that filtered shadow techniques have.
*  Filtering using SATs is fast and very good quality, but works much better for larger kernel sizes.
*  Floating-point precision caused a lot of issue.
